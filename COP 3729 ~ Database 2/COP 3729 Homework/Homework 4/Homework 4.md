### Returning Queries

``` cypher
MATCH p=()-[r:KNOWS]->() RETURN p
```

![knows](Homework 4.assets/knows-4920719.png)

```cypher
MATCH p=()-[r:RELATEDTO]->() RETURN p
```

![relatedto](Homework 4.assets/relatedto.png)

I couldn’t figure out how to get this one to only show people that are related to each other and not put everyone that is related to someone else together.

```cypher
MATCH p=()-[r:ROOMIESWITH]->() RETURN p
```

![roomieswith](Homework 4.assets/roomieswith.png)

Same problem as above on this one.

```cypher
MATCH p=()-[r:SCHOOLWITH]->() RETURN p
```

![schoolwith](Homework 4.assets/schoolwith.png)

```cypher
MATCH p=()-[r:WORKSFOR]->() RETURN p
```

![worksfor](Homework 4.assets/worksfor.png)

```cypher
MATCH p=()-[r:WORKSWITH]->() RETURN p
```

![workswith](Homework 4.assets/workswith.png)

Same problem here too.
