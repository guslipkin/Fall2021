# Netflix Data Discussion

Hello, everyone! I'm Gus, a senior in Business Analytics with concentrations in Intelligent Mobility and Quantitative Economics and Econometrics.

 

- I thought it was interesting how Michelle maintains that the reason they are able to work so much with data science is the direction from company leadership that allows and encourages their activities. 
- Michelle sort of touches on [Chaos Monkey](https://netflix.github.io/chaosmonkey/) which is Netflix’s tool that allows them to test different parts of their product to see how much can break before it’s unusable. I highly recommend looking into it a bit more.
- She likes Jupyter notebooks! They’re pretty cool. I also recommend looking into them if you haven’t. They’re like R Notebooks (if you’re familiar) but a bit more interactive and hosted online. There’s even a way to hook them into Google Drive.
- More Chaos Monkey!
- She talks a bit about using data science to make title recommendations, I wonder if they use the same systems to try and recommend new movies or TV Shows to produce. Tom Scott made a video about this that can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfVYxnhuEdU
