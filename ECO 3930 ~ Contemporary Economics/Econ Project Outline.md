## Idea

â€‹	The current tutoring system is broken. Each department pays their own tutors for specific classes, and those tutors are only registered to tutor for those specific classes. Each tutor could tutor for many classes, including ones outside their department, but are not able to due to departmental restrictions. If each department pooled together, they could hire tutors to cover a wider breadth of classes while paying the same number, or even fewer, tutors. This is a classic case of the tragedy of the commons where if the departments pooled resources, the students would be better off for it. However, each department is acting in their own best interest so the students have less supports available to them.
