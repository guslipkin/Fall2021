# Exam 2 Prep - Rational Addiction Model Problem

## Assumptions and Set Up

- Suppose there are three time periods in a life, 1, 2, and 3 (youth, middle age, and old age). 
- Alice is deciding whether to use a drug which is she knows is addictive. 
- The current payoff Alice receives from using a drug which she knows is addictive is $v=6$ at 
  time 1, $v=5$ at time 2, and $v=0$ at time 3. 
- Since the drug is addictive, Alice will not be able to regulate her use to eliminate future negative 
  impacts of use. If Alice uses the drug at t=1, she suffers a cost (e.g. lost productivity or poor 
  health) of $c=6$ at $t=2$. If she uses at $t=2$, she suffers a cost of $c=8$ at $t=3$. 
- Treat each time period’s Alice as if they play a non-cooperative game against the other time 
  period’s Alices, where the three players are $A_1$, $A_2$, and $A_3$. 
- Utility each period is the sum of drug utility and drug costs, $u_t=v_t-c_t$. 
- At each period, Alice values her past and future utilities according to a discount factor of 0.5 
  per unit distance in time. So, for example, $A_2$’s total utility is $U_2=0.5u_1+u_2+0.5u_3$. 

## Questions

1. Show that $A_1$ and $A_2$ will chooses to use the drug. 
2. Show that, from behind a veil of ignorance with respect to which player she would actually turn out to be, Alice would choose to make the drug unavailable if it were costless to do so. 
3. For simplicity, assume the government moves resources freely across time (really the social discount rate is about $3\%$, with a value one period in the future worth $\frac{1}{1.03}$ that amount in the current period). Show the government could raise enough revenue from $A_2$ and/or $A_3$ to pay off both $A_1$ and $A_2$ not to use drugs in such a way that all three Alice’s are happier. (This means drug use is not Kaldor-Hicks efficient, at least in this case.) 
4. If drug use in this model is not Kaldor-Hicks efficient, and if Alice, behind the veil of ignorance, would choose to make it unavailable to herself if it were free to do so, how can this be said to be a model of rational addiction? 
5. Discuss generally how the analysis would change if there was a chance Alice would be addicted and a chance she would be able to regulate her use to avoid serious future costs. In such cases, is it still clear drugs should be unavailable? Would an addicted $A_2$ and $A_3$ be better off if $A_3$ could pay off $A_2$ to quit?
